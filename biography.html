									<h3>Dog training a labour of love:</h3>
									<p>I have been brought up as a Gaucho in a rural environment, surrounded by horses, cows, sheep and dogs.  I was taught to understand animal behaviours and persuaded them to collaborate with human activities.  I have been brought up with horses during the first years of my childhood, My horse was my best friend. Some years later my father bought me a Dobermann pincher with an impressive pedigree, She was trained for completion. I witnessed all training sessions and I knew that I wanted to be a Dog trainer at my early age of 8 years old. My Dobermann won some competitions. </p>

									<h3>K9 training and own Vet business</h3>
									<p>During my early 17 years old I started to work apprentice for a local Dog trainer, I learnt a lot about  dog behaviours and training techniques. Then I was introduced to another Dog trainer. He hired my for my passion for this career.  I worked with him for several years until I realised that I wanted to study Vet at university. I studied veterinary for some years at the university of Buenos Aires Argentina. Nonetheless my heart was always with  dog’s behaviour. I quit university and returned to work as Dog trainer. Unfortunately my family did not support that decision. Later on my career I started to work with the German’s shepherd club where I learnt a lot of Dog exhibitions, training competitions and breading. I specialised on the K9 training.</p>

									<p>I started my own business breeding black Belgium shepherd. I trained them and sold them as working dogs.  I also carried on working as dog trainer and  breeder for 15 years.
										Until I got a licence to Open a Vet shop in Buenos Aires.  I worked as Director of my own Vet shop in Buenos Aires.  I hired 3 vets.  I am registered as Vet shop director in the Buenos Aires Vet college.</p>

									<h3>Moving to UK</h3>
									<p>Due to unprecedented circumstances I moved to the UK and started to work as a Dog trainer using  K9 dog training. My trained dogs participated in two dog exhibitions in he UK, wining the first and second place.  Currently I continues working as dog trainer helping families and dogs to be happier.</p>
